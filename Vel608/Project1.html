        <p>The first task of this course was to create a website using HTML and upload it to GitHub. The website serves as a journal for the course and also serves as a personal portfolio, it includes a resume and a detailed description of the process involved in completing the project.    </p><br>
        <h3 class = header>The process</h3> 
        Before starting the project, I received assistance from my friend Kristján Leó to set up Git on my computer and learn about its functions. After initial setup, no work was done until January 22nd. Initially, an HTML template was downloaded and modified using Brackets, but I found understanding the code challenging, so I decided to start from scratch. I favored the aesthetic appeal of a cleaner and minimalist design, although it required a significant investment of time. Nevertheless, I gained valuable knowledge and experience in HTML and CSS, and I anticipated that this might be reflected positively in my project evaluation. I relied heavily on this video tutorial to learn HTML and CSS.

        <p>The video tutorial helped me to understand the basics of HTML, which I used to build the homepage. Positioning text and images on the page was a challenge, but I eventually succeeded. Through reviewing projects from previous students in this course, I discovered that <a href="https://allitob.github.io/" target ="_blank">Atli's website</a> was also built from scratch. Inspecting his website's elements using the right-click option allowed me to understand his building process. It was easier to use his website for guidance rather than those made using templates, as the code was likely to be simpler. I borrowed the code for the navigation tab on the <a href="../index.html">homepage</a> and the embedded YouTube video from his website. The YouTube video is currently not working, but according to stackoverflow this is may due to the localhost environment, and the issue will be resolved. </p>

            After creating a half-acceptable homepage the subsequent step was to construct the page dedicated to the course <a href = "VEL608.html">VÉL608/Modern manufacturing processes</a>. In browsing various homepages, seeking insporation for the layout and design, I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/podcast" target="_blank">3blue1brown's website</a> and I found the podcast section of his page to be appealing. I subsequently attempted to emulate this design for the selection on this website for this course's projects. This endeavor consumed an inordinate amount of time, as I encountered difficulties in consolidating images and text into a single block or anchor element. Like previously I accessed the code through inspect element. <br> The youtube video I was trying to embed still didn't work. I remembered <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">chatGPT</a> by open AI and I gave it the prompt "I am unable to embed a youtube video in a webpage using HTML". ChatGPT solved the issue for me. in order to embed a YouTube video on a website using HTML, the video must be referred to in the following format: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID" , as opposed to the standard format for a YouTube link which is "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID". The key difference is that the "/watch?v=" portion of the standard link must be replaced with "/embed/". This format allows the video to be integrated into the website as an iframe element, rather than simply linking to the video on the YouTube website. Despite efforts, the embedded YouTube video remains of inadequate dimensions, the solution to improve the size of the embedded video eludes me.

        </p><br> While doing this I was routinely updating my online github repository. The following video was used for gaining a general understanding of git and github.

    <div class = Section_wrapper> <p> I didn't manage to create the resume before the due date. I applied everything I had learned and created a simple resume, taking inspiraiton from the CV on <a href="https://sigurbjorglovisa.github.io/Sigurbjorglovisa/" target="_blank">Sigurbjörg's website</a>  </p> </div>
