        <p>The first assignment in this course was to make a website using HTML and then upload it to github. The website should include a resume and a detailed description of the process involved in completing this project. The website is thought of first and foremost as a journal for this course but it can serve as a personal portfolio.   </p><br>
        <h3 class = header>The process</h3> <br>
        Before starting work on the website I recieved help from a friend, Kristján Leó,  he set up git on my computer and tought me about what it does and how it works. He also helped me getting started on creating a blank website. After that no work was done on this project until today, 22. january. First an HTML template was downloaded, I started modifying the text on the website in <a href="https://brackets.io/" target = "_blank">Brackets</a>  but I quickly gave up on that because I didn't know anything about HTML and didn't understand what any of the code meant. Trying to insert myself in to a big wall of code and trying to reverse engineer it seemed overwhelming so I just started from scratch. I ended up liking the cleaner minimalist look a lot more too. This ended up being a mistake as it consumed a lot of time when there wasn't a lot of it, but I also learned a lot about HTML and CSS. First I relied heavily on this video to learn HTML and CSS:
             <div class = videowrapper>
                 <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZGeaHPoaw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow=" clipboard-write; encrypted-media;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
             </div>
        <p>This helped a lot get an understanding of the basics of HTML to build the homepage. Getting the text and image to the places I wanted them was a hassle but accomplished eventually. Looking at projects from previous students in this course, I saw that <a href="https://allitob.github.io/" target ="_blank">Atli's website</a> was also built from scratch. Right clicking and inspecting element on his website allowed me to see how he carried out building the website. It's easier to utilize his website for help rather than ones that were made using templates as the code is likely to be much simpler. The code for the navigation tab on the top of the <a href="../index.html">homepage</a> was gotten from his website. Copied was also the code from his website to embed the above youtube video. The youtube video is not working as of right now but according to stack overflow that might because I'm on a localhost environment so the issue will hopefully resolve itself. </p>
        <br>

        After creating a half-acceptable homepage the next step was to build the <a href = "VEL608.html">VÉL608/Modern manufacturing processes</a> page. I was looking at random websites for some ideas to steal and stumpled upon <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/podcast" target="_blank">3blue1brown's website</a> and I liked how the podcast section page looked. I decided to try to organize and style the page for the selection of projects in this course like he organized and styled his podcast episode selection section. This took way too much time. Like previously I accessed the code through inspect element. Trying to get the image and the different lines of text in to one block or one anchor element took the most amount of time. Getting the animation to work also took some time. <br> The next step was supposed to be working on my CV but I am tragically running out of time and will have to update this website at a later date.
